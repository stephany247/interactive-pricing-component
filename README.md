## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - For styles


### What I learned

I improved my handling of range input styling and functionality while also gaining a better understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout structuring. I learned to use semantic HTML for better accessibility and applied React state management to update pricing dynamically.


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my range input styling and making it more accessible and user-friendly. I also aim to refine my CSS Grid and Flexbox skills to ensure better layout responsiveness across different screen sizes. Additionally, I'll continue working on form accessibility and best practices to improve usability and semantic structure.
